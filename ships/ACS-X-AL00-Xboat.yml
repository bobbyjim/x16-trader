      Express Boat (Type X): Constructed using a 100t lifting body hull, the express boat (also called an xboat) is fitted with drives producing jump-4, and nothing else. The fit is so tight that there is no room even for maneuver drives or power plant: instead, the power plant is embedded in a Self-Processing Jump Drive (see below). Fuel tankage is 40 tons, enough for one jump. The standard bridge is complemented by a Model/4fib computer, massive communicators, and message data banks. The ship has two staterooms; one is necessary for the single crew member, while the other can carry a passenger. More often, the pilot uses the second room for additional living space. There is a one ton cargo bay which is occasionally used to carry vital cargo such as vaccines or sophisticated repair parts. 
      
      The express boat costs MCr70.2 to construct.
      
      Self-Processing Jump Drive. A specialized drive consisting of a power plant slaved to a jump drive. Total tonnage is the sum of the two drives minus four tons, and the price is the same as buying the two drives separately. The power plant only powers the jump drive, and does not require any fuel besides that used by the jump drive. Ships with a self-processing jump drive may not install a Power Plant, though they may have alternate sources of power (e.g. F+ or antimatter).
