Let's try creating a "game state" that could be copied down 
and re-inserted into a game to reset it.

MVP:

(1) the current star system: 12 bits (0 - 4095).
(2) the ship number: 7 bits (0-127).
(3) cargo lots converted to cash.
(4) cash on hand in MCr: 8 bits (0-255).
(5) does not include additional state.

EXAMPLE.  

current system:   18DB (6363 base 16)
ship number:      7F   (127 base 16)
cash in MCr:      FF   (255 base 16)

Encoded:          18DB7FFF in base 16

Eight characters is EASY.
